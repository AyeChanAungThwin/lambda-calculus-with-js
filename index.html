        <h3 class="title">Abstraction: What and Why?</h3>
        <p>
            Everything can be expressed as a function. But it shouldn't be used everywhere. Once it is populated with
            arguments, its state cannot be changed. Therefore, you have to create another function if you ever once to
            use the same function again. That creates more memory consumption. But the functional paradigm becomes
            popular again because it gives good readability abstracted in a short code. There's also enough memory to
            execute them nowadays.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the lower-level perspective of a programming language. You can say, "semantics of the functional
            programming." So, you need to be an expert in one of the high-level programming languages. And you also need
            to be a good problem solver. Otherwise, this is just wasting your time!
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, you know what and why. And we're a bit behind the schedule. So, let's start learning it right now!

    <section class="container what-is-a-function">
        <h3 class="title">What is a function?</h3>
        <p>A function is a black box where you can't see what's inside. If you wanna know if two functions do the same
            thing, you have to put something in it and see if they give us the same result. Let's say there are two
            functions; <span class="equation">f(x)=2x</span>, and <span class="equation">g(x)=x+x</span>, you can't know
            if f(x) is equal g(x) without putting a value in it.</p>
        <p><span class="equation">f(x)=2x</span>, <span class="equation">f(2)=2*2=4</span></p>
        <p><span class="equation">g(x)=x+x</span>, <span class="equation">g(2)=2+2=4</span></p>
        <p>Hence, <span class="equation">f(2)</span> is equal to <span class="equation">g(2)</span>.</p>

    <section class="container birds">
        <h3 class="title">Birds</h3>
        <p>We represent a function with a bird. Each bird is a function. Each function can have one or more functions or
            arguments inside it and we called them layers.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container function">
        <h3 class="title">Idiot</h3>
        <p>This is the one layer bird. It takes only one argument and return it. It seems to have no intelligence at
            all. That's why we called it, "Idiot" or "Identity." And we present it with "I."
        </p>
        <p>Half-circle on the left of the box represents a bird's ear and the right one represents its throat. The
            dotted box encloses the solid line and one box represents one layer. The solid line is a pipe which shows the direction of
            flow the information from ear to throat. Normally, it goes from left to right. We don't use arrow head
            except to indicate reverse flow. <span class="fyi">FYI, ear to the throat is connected by a canal! The
                Eustachian tube is a small passageway that connects your throat to your middle ear.</span></p>
        <div class="animation-container">
            <div class="screen">
                <div class="bird-name code">I</div>
                <div class="bird idiot">
                    <div class="arrow arrow-idiot"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="input code">1</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Just like <span class="equation">f(x)=x</span>, this one is <span class="equation">I(a)=a</span>. <span
                class="equation">I</span> is a function that takes <span class="equation">a</span> as an argument and
            returns <span class="equation">a</span>. It takes one argument and so Idiot is one-layered bird. You can try
            it, with the syntax of JavaScript's arrow function in console of a browser.
        </p>
        <p class="code">let I = a => a;</p>
        <p class="code">I(0) <span class="comment">//will return 0.</span></p>
        <p class="code">I(1) <span class="comment">//will return 1.</span></p>
        <p>

        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container function">
        <h3 class="title">Kestrel</h3>
        <p>It is the two layer bird. It takes two arguments and return the first one. If you put 1 and then 2, it will
            only return 1. because the second argument has no connection from ear to throat. <span class="fyi">Note that pipes can be passed freely from outter box to inner box without having to pass through inner box's ear.</span></p>
        <div class="animation-container">
            <div class="screen">
                <div class="bird-name code">K</div>
                <div class="bird kestrel-layer-1">
                </div>
                <div class="bird kestrel-layer-2">
                </div>
                <div class="arrow arrow-kestrel-1"></div>
                <!-- <div class="arrow arrow-kestrel-2"></div> -->
                <div class="input kestrel-input-1 code">a</div>
                <div class="input kestrel-input-2 code">b</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>You can try it, with the syntax of JavaScript's arrow function in console of a browser.
        </p>
        <p class="code">let K = a => b => a;</p>
        <p class="code">K(0)(1) <span class="comment">//will return 0.</span></p>
        <p class="code">K(1)(2) <span class="comment">//will return 1.</span></p>
        <p>As you can see, Kestrel always return the first thing and so you can neglect the second one. Kestrel can be
            used as a constant. For example, <span class="equation">K(3)</span> will always gives you back <span
                class="equation">3</span>. That's called the constant. And we can create like this.</p>
        <p class="code">
            let K3 = K(3);
        </p>
        <p class="code">
            K3 <span class="comment">//will return 3.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Forget about its syntax and look at the sequence that executes. Does it look familiar to you?</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container function">
        <h3 class="title">True/False Function</h3>
        <p>In the ternary operation of the high-level syntax, it will be like the following...</p>
        <p class="code">boolean?value1:value2;</p>
        <p>If <span class="equation">boolean</span> is true, it returns the first one; <span class="equation">value1</span>. So, <span class="equation">Kestrel</span> is the <span class="equation">TRUE function</span>. So, what's the <span class="equation">FALSE function</span>? It returns the second thing. Now, you get both TRUE and FALSE functions.</p>
        <p class="code">let T = K;</p>
        <p class="code">let F = a => b => b;</p>
        <p></p>
